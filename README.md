# IndiaAI CyberGuard AI Hackathon - Neural Network Guard

Welcome to **NeuralNetworkGuard**, a project built for the **IndiaAI CyberGuard AI Hackathon**. This project tackles the classification of a large, unstructured text dataset into predefined categories and subcategories in alignment with Government of India rules and regulations. The goal is to explore the data, define the context of each category, and use advanced machine learning techniques to achieve accurate classification.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a robust solution for classifying large volumes of unstructured text data provided in the hackathon. The primary focus is on building a machine learning model that can classify text descriptions into multiple subcategories and categories. Given the challengeâ€™s alignment with Indian government standards, the classifications must be accurate, relevant, and compliant with official guidelines.

**Objectives**:
- To preprocess and analyze the dataset.
- To define the context and meaning of each category and subcategory.
- To build a high-performing model for text classification.
- To evaluate and visualize model performance to ensure accuracy and compliance.

## Challenge Description

The **IndiaAI CyberGuard AI Hackathon** dataset comprises approximately **1.56 lakh rows of raw text descriptions**. Participants are expected to:
1. Understand and define each provided category and subcategory based on the dataset.
2. Classify the text data accurately into these categories and subcategories.
3. Ensure that the classification aligns with Government of India rules and regulations for standardized reporting and analysis.
