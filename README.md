## Overview
The **NeuralNetworkGuard** project focuses on the basics of neural networks, including:
- **Data Preparation**: Loading, exploring, and pre-processing data for neural network training.
- **Model Architecture**: Building and compiling a basic neural network model with essential layers and activation functions.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Training the model, monitoring performance, and evaluating model accuracy.

**Objective**: To provide a clear, hands-on understanding of the neural network lifecycle, from data preparation to evaluation, with supporting visualizations to aid comprehension.
